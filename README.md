# The VBA of Wall Street

### Objective

* The script will loop through all the stocks and take the following info:

	* Yearly change from the stock price at the beginning of the year to the price at the end of the year.

	* The percent change in that stock’s price from the beginning of the year to the end.

	* The total volume of the stock traded over the year with ticker symbol

* Applied conditional formatting to highlight a yearly increase in the stock price in green, and a decrease in the stock price in red.

* Identified the stock with the greatest percentage increase in its price; the stock that suffered the greatest percentage decrease in its price; and finally, identified the stock with the greatest trade volume.

* The script covered every worksheet by running it once.
